# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project focuses on the development and optimization of a deep learning model designed for highly accurate brain tumor detection in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.


Project goal: 
The goal of this project is to To Detect and Classify a Brain Tumor using, CNN this will be using multi-class clasification taking the types of tumors glioma, meningioma, pituitary into acount.

the training data will be mri scan images taken from the kaggle Brain tumor mri dataset.
